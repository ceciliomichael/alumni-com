### Summary of Changes:

#### Officer Information in User Profiles

- **Data Structure Enhancement**:
  - Added `officerPosition` field to the User interface to store officer title, date range, and batch info
  - Added `showOfficerInfo` boolean flag for users to control visibility of officer information

- **User Interface Enhancements**:
  - Added a toggle in profile settings for users to show/hide their officer position
  - Added an officer badge next to the user's name in their profile header
  - Created a detailed officer information section in the profile with start/end dates
  - Implemented visual indication when officer info is only visible to the user (private mode)

- **Admin Integration**:
  - Connected the officer management system to user profiles automatically
  - When an admin assigns an officer position, it automatically appears on the user's profile
  - When an admin removes an officer, the information is also removed from the user's profile
  - Updated confirmation dialogs to clearly explain the effects of removing officers

  - Created distinctive officer badge with accent colors and clean layout
  - Styled officer information section with borders, spacing, and improved typography
  - Made all components fully responsive for mobile viewing

### Current Status:

The alumni management system now successfully connects officer positions to user profiles. When an alumni officer is assigned, the information automatically appears on their profile with relevant details. Users have control over whether this information is displayed publicly or kept private through a toggle in their profile settings.

When viewing a profile, officer information is clearly displayed with a badge next to the username and detailed information in the profile. The UI correctly handles cases where the officer position is private but being viewed by the profile owner (showing a "Only visible to you" note).

The admin dashboard has been updated to maintain consistency between the officer records and user profiles, ensuring that when officers are added, edited, or removed, the corresponding user profiles are updated accordingly.

### Next Steps:

1. Consider adding batch/graduation year filtering to the officer assignment dropdown for easier selection of alumni
2. Add officer search capability in the admin dashboard for larger databases
3. Consider adding history tracking for past officer positions
4. Test the system with a larger dataset to ensure performance
