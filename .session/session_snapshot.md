# Session Snapshot - August 6, 2024

## Overview

Today's session focused on fixing issues with the right sidebar components and user profile data persistence. The main improvements addressed visual inconsistencies in the sidebar's empty states and ensured that profile changes (especially cover photos) properly update throughout the application.

## Changes Made

### Right Sidebar Improvements

1. **Fixed Events Display:**
   - Replaced "Recommended: 800x400px" placeholder with proper empty state design
   - Added appropriate icons for empty events and jobs sections
   - Created a new CSS class `empty-content-image` for consistent styling
   - Added a "View All Events" button for consistency with the Jobs section

2. **Data Synchronization:**
   - Initialized event and job data on component mount
   - Added storage event listeners to refresh data when it changes
   - Improved data filtering to show only approved and upcoming items

### User Profile & Data Persistence

1. **Cover Photo Display in Sidebar:**
   - Fixed issue where cover photo updates weren't showing in the sidebar
   - Added proper styling for cover photos in the sidebar profile card
   - Ensured consistent image scaling and positioning

2. **User Data Synchronization:**
   - Enhanced HomePage component to track user state separately from props
   - Added localStorage event listeners to detect and refresh user data
   - Updated all profile data references to use the current user state

## Files Modified

- `src/pages/Home/components/Sidebar/SidebarRight.tsx`
- `src/pages/Home/components/Sidebar/SidebarLeft.tsx`
- `src/pages/Home/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.css`
- `src/pages/Home/HomePage.tsx`

## Testing Notes

- Verified that cover photo updates in profile now appear correctly in the sidebar
- Confirmed that empty states in the sidebar display properly without placeholder text
- Tested data synchronization by making changes to user profile and verifying updates

## Next Steps

1. Continue refining any remaining UI inconsistencies
2. Add more robust data validation for user inputs
3. Review localStorage usage patterns for potential optimizations
4. Conduct comprehensive testing across all features
