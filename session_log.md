# Session Log - [Current Date]

**Goal:** Implement the user-facing UI for the Alumni Community Platform (Login, Register, Home Page) based on `project-requirements.md` and the provided hierarchy image, focusing on aesthetics and layout using React, TypeScript, CSS, and Lucide Icons.

**Summary of Activities:**

1.  **Project Setup & Core Structure:**
    *   Reviewed project requirements and technology stack (React, TypeScript, Vite).
    *   Established basic folder structure (`src/pages`, `src/components`, `src/types`).
    *   Created `src/types/index.ts` with interfaces for `User`, `Post`, `Comment`, etc.
    *   Set up main application component (`src/App.tsx`) with `react-router-dom` for routing between Login, Register, and Home pages.
    *   Implemented basic mock authentication state management (using `useState` and `localStorage`) in `App.tsx`.
    *   Created basic type interfaces for various data entities to ensure type safety across the application.
    *   Set up theme variables in CSS for consistent styling and easier theming.

2.  **Layout & Styling:**
    *   Created the main `Layout` component (`src/components/Layout/Layout.tsx`) with a fixed header (including navigation and user menu) and a footer.
    *   Implemented responsive design for the header navigation (collapsing into a mobile menu).
    *   Created corresponding CSS (`src/components/Layout/Layout.css`) for the layout with detailed styling for navigation, dropdown menus, and user avatars.
    *   Established global styles and CSS variables in `src/index.css` for consistency.
    *   Added transitions and hover effects to enhance user experience with subtle animations.
    *   Implemented box shadows and border handling to create depth and visual hierarchy across components.
    *   Created responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes (992px and 576px).

3.  **Authentication Pages (UI Only):**
    *   Created `LoginPage` component (`src/pages/Auth/LoginPage.tsx`) with form fields (email, password), basic validation, and mock login handling.
    *   Created `RegisterPage` component (`src/pages/Auth/RegisterPage.tsx`) with form fields (name, email, batch, password, confirm password), validation, and a success message display upon mock submission.
    *   Styled both auth pages using shared CSS (`src/pages/Auth/Auth.css`), including input styles with icons and a right-side illustrative panel.
    *   Added form validation with visual error messaging and input highlighting.
    *   Implemented "forgot password" functionality linked to a password reset form.
    *   Created a "Remember me" checkbox with proper styling and state handling.

4.  **Home Page Implementation (UI Only):**
    *   Created `HomePage` component (`src/pages/Home/HomePage.tsx`) with a 3-column layout.
    *   Created `PostForm` component (`src/pages/Home/components/PostForm/PostForm.tsx`) for creating new posts, including an expanding textarea and action buttons.
    *   Created `PostList` component (`src/pages/Home/components/PostList/PostList.tsx`) to display mock posts, including handling likes (mock), displaying comments, and a comment input form.
    *   Implemented date formatting for post/comment timestamps.
    *   Created `SidebarLeft` component (`src/pages/Home/components/Sidebar/SidebarLeft.tsx`) displaying user profile summary and navigation links.
    *   Created `SidebarRight` component (`src/pages/Home/components/Sidebar/SidebarRight.tsx`) displaying mock upcoming events, job opportunities, announcements, and alumni spotlight sections.
    *   Added corresponding CSS files for `HomePage`, `PostForm`, `PostList`, and `Sidebar` components.
    *   Implemented hover effects on posts and interactive elements to enhance user experience.
    *   Added media queries to ensure proper display on different device sizes.

5.  **Assets & Documentation:**
    *   Created placeholder SVG illustrations for login and registration pages (`public/images/`).
    *   Created placeholder text files representing image assets for avatars and posts (`public/images/avatars/`, `public/images/posts/`).
    *   Updated `index.html` with appropriate title, description, and font links.
    *   Created a simple SVG `favicon.svg`.
    *   Generated a `README.md` documenting the project setup, structure, and current status.
    *   Added detailed comments throughout the codebase to explain complex logic and styling decisions.

6.  **Debugging & Refinements:**
    *   Resolved recurring `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'charAt')` errors in `Layout.tsx`, `SidebarLeft.tsx`, and `PostForm.tsx` by adding checks for potentially null/undefined `user.name` properties and providing fallback values.
    *   Adjusted the layout width by increasing `max-width` in `src/index.css` and removing `max-width` from the main content area in `src/pages/Home/Home.css` to make the Home page less constrained, as requested.
    *   Fixed inconsistent spacing issues between components and sections.
